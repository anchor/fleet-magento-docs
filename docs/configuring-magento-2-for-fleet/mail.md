To ensure your store's mail gets delivered correctly, you'll want to make sure
your Return-Path is set to a valid and working email address, otherwise mail
servers will reject your store's mail.

### Configuration

System -> Configuration -> Advanced -> System -> Mail Sending Settings

 * Set Return-Path:   **Specified**
 * Return-Path Email: **set this to a valid address where bounce messages will be received**
