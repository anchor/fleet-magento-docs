Set up New Relic Integration
---------------------

Fleet can integrate with your New Relic account to provide you
with insight into your application's performance.

To get set up just **send Anchor a support request** with your **New Relic licence key** and
we will configure any new releases to report to New Relic.

These will report with the Application Name: `fleet-<fleet name>-<environment>-<role>`.
